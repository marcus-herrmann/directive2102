    <h2>About/Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>This website is a private, non-official project - and by no means a complete neither a legal reflection of EU Directive 2016/2102. I, a web developer living in Europe interested in web accessibility, tried to wrap my head around this directive and wrote the summary of Directive 2102 I didn't find online.</p>

      <p>Since this project is <a href="https://github.com/marcus-herrmann/directive2102">open source and on GitHub</a> feel free to join and correct formulations if necessary.</p>
