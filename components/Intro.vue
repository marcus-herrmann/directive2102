      <h2>What is Directive 2102?</h2>

      <ul class="text-list">
        <li class="text-list">The complete title is <strong>Directive (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies</strong>.</li>
        <li>Just like <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> was standardisation of privacy laws
          across <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Directive 2016/2102 is standardisation of accessibility laws across the European Union.</li>
        <li>And like <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> it came into effect in 2016 already, 26 October 2016 to be exact.</li>
        <li>However, unlike the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GPDR</abbr>, it is a directive, not a regulation. Quote, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)">Wikipedia</a>:

          <blockquote>A directive is a legal act of the European Union which requires member states to achieve a
            particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from
            regulations, which
            are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures.
          </blockquote>

          Meaning: a directive does not automatically becomes law in all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, but binds the states to adopt
          its content into national law. This has to happen for Directive 2102 until <strong>23 September 2018.</strong>
          The following will also apply: Any <strong><em>new</em></strong> website of the public sector released after
          this date has to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>, Level AA by <strong>23 December 2018</strong>. See section <a href="#timeline" v-smooth-scroll>Timeline</a> for further deadlines.
