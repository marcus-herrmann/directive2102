      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <ul class="text-list">
        <li>The directive includes websites, mobile apps, intranets and documents of public sector bodies.</li>
        <li>At the latest by <strong>23 December 2018</strong> a <strong>technical specification</strong> regarding
          accessibility of these channels and forms of media will be published by the European Commission.
        </li>
        <li>Until then and as mentioned above, regarding web accessibility Directive 2102 orientates itself at <strong>Web
          Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA</strong> by taking reference to <a
          href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/01.01.02_60/en_301549v010102p.pdf">EN 301 549,
          PDF, Chapter 9:
          Web</a></li>
        <li>The directive also regulates accessibility of mobile apps. Mobile accessibility is not heavily
          emphasized/considered in WCAG 2.0, but it's addendum WCAG 2.1. Some accessibility experts suppose Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 to be the basis for an supplemental European Standard/technical specification.
        </li>
        <li><strong>National governments must regularly supervise the public sector's adherence to the law</strong>. A
          standardized
          methodology for this supervision will be communicated by the European Commission at latest December 22, 2018.
        </li>
        <li>Accessibility or non-accessibility of public sector websites, web and mobile apps, intranets and documents
          must be publicly stated and recorded. If digital products and services do not suffice WCAG 2.0 this
          <strong>accessibility statement</strong> has to offer an explanation and an accessible alternative.
        </li>
        <li>The directive describes <strong>minimum</strong> accessibility requirements, but individual countries can
          also make more
          far-reaching regulations. Article 2 states: "Member States may maintain or introduce measures in conformity
          with
          Union law which go beyond the minimum requirements for accessibility of websites and mobile applications
          established by this Directive."
